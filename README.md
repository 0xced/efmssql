Microsoft's SqlClient has a long standing issue (#26): [Cancelling an async SqlClient operation throws SqlException, not TaskCanceledException](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/26)

It is problematic because whenever an SQL command is canceled, an `InvalidOperationException`, a `SqlException` or a  `TaskCanceledException` will be randomly thrown . This is also a showstopper when using [Blazor virtualization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/virtualization#item-provider-delegate) where an `OperationCanceledException` is [expected to signal cancelation](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/v10.0.0/src/Components/Web/src/Virtualization/Virtualize.cs#L441-L444).

This project provides a workaround that leverages EF Core [execution strategies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/connection-resiliency). When using this workaround, querying the db context will consistently throw an `OperationCanceledException` upon cancelation.

```c#
try
{
  await dbContext.Tracks.CountAsync(cancellationToken);
}
catch (OperationCanceledException ex) when (ex.CancellationToken == cancellationToken)
{
  // Alwas caught with the workaround applied. Uncaught with SqlClient default behavior.
}
```

## Getting started

Add the [WorkaroundSqlClientIssue26](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WorkaroundSqlClientIssue26/) NuGet package to your project using the NuGet Package Manager or run the following command:

```sh
dotnet add package WorkaroundSqlClientIssue26
```

Install the workaround when configuring the db context options.

```c#
var options = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<MyDbContext>()
  .UseSqlServer(connectionString, sql => sql.WorkAroundSqlClientIssue26())
  .Options;
```

This workaround is also compatible with a [custom execution strategy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/connection-resiliency#custom-execution-strategy) such as retry on failure.

```c#
var options = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<MyDbContext>()
  .UseSqlServer(connectionString, s => s.EnableRetryOnFailure().WorkAroundSqlClientIssue26())
  .Options;
```

Since version 2.0.0, it is also compatible with [Azure SQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.sqlserverdbcontextoptionsextensions.useazuresql) and [Azure Synapse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.sqlserverdbcontextoptionsextensions.useazuresynapse).

```c#
var options = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<MyDbContext>()
  .UseAzureSql(connectionString, s => s.WorkAroundSqlClientIssue26())
  .Options;
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

* What are the supported EF Core versions?
  * For version 1.0.0, EF Core 8, 9 and 10 are supported.
  * For version 2.0.0, EF Core 10 is supported.
  * Future versions should work too.


* Why is this package required? Why doesn't EF Core take care of throwing a proper `OperationCanceledException`?
  * EF Core [distinguishes cancelation from failure](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/26988), but only for logging purposes. A maintainer of EF Core [said this](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/26#issuecomment-1598942832):
    > EF makes no attempt to correct SqlClient's behavior here by throwing a different type of exception; it just distinguishes between failure and cancellation.


* What happens if the original issue gets fixed?
  * If SqlClient issue #26 is fixed, this workaround will turn into a no-op.
